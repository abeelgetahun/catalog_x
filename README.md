# Catalog X - Flutter BLoC Assessment

A professional product catalog application built with Flutter and BLoC pattern, featuring clean architecture, offline support, and modern UI design.

## Features

- 📱 **Product Catalog**: Grid layout with search and category filtering
- 🔍 **Smart Search**: Debounced search with 400ms delay
- 🏷️ **Category Filters**: Horizontal scrollable chips for easy filtering
- 📄 **Product Details**: Comprehensive product information with images
- 🔄 **Pull-to-Refresh**: Refresh product data with intuitive gesture
- ♾️ **Infinite Scroll**: Seamless pagination with automatic loading
- 🌐 **Offline Support**: Cached data available without internet
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Material 3 design with smooth animations
- 🏗️ **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with testable code
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for BLoCs and widget tests

## Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of layers:

📁 Presentation Layer (UI + BLoC)
↓
📁 Domain Layer (Entities + Use Cases)
↓
📁 Data Layer (Repository + Data Sources)

### Key Components

- **BLoC Pattern**: State management with flutter_bloc
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction between data sources
- **Dependency Injection**: GetIt for managing dependencies
- **Network Layer**: Dio for HTTP requests with error handling
- **Caching**: SharedPreferences for offline data persistence
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and widget tests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.19+ 
- Dart 3.0+
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Internet connection for initial data fetch

API Integration
The app uses the Fake Store API for product data:

Products: GET /products with pagination
Categories: GET /products/categories
Product Details: GET /products/{id}
Category Filter: GET /products/category/{name}
Technical Implementation
State Management
The app uses BLoC pattern with the following key blocs:

CatalogBloc: Manages product list, search, filters, and pagination
ProductDetailBloc: Handles individual product detail loading
Caching Strategy
First Page Cache: Only the first page of products is cached to prevent storage bloat
Category Cache: All categories are cached for offline filtering
Product Details: Individual products are cached when viewed
Network Awareness: Automatically falls back to cache when offline
Search & Filtering
Debounced Search: 400ms delay prevents excessive API calls
Composable Filters: Search works in combination with category filters
Client-side Logic: Filtering and pagination handled locally for better performance
Pagination
Infinite Scroll: Automatically loads more items when user scrolls to bottom
Page Management: Tracks current page and whether more items are available
Loading States: Clear indicators for initial loading vs. loading more
UI/UX Features
Material 3 Design: Modern, accessible interface
Responsive Grid: Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
Staggered Animations: Smooth item appearance animations
Loading Shimmer: Skeleton loading for better perceived performance
Error Handling: User-friendly error messages with retry options
Image Caching: Efficient image loading with cached_network_image
Testing Strategy
Unit Tests
CatalogBloc: Happy path and error scenarios
Repository: Data source integration
Mock Dependencies: Isolated component testing
Widget Tests
CatalogPage: Loading, success, and error states
User Interactions: Search, filter, and navigation
State Verification: UI reflects bloc state changes
Trade-offs & Decisions
Architectural Decisions
Client-side Pagination: Fake Store API limitations required client-side implementation
Limited Caching: Only cache first page to prevent storage issues
Repository Pattern: Abstraction allows easy switching between data sources
BLoC over Provider: Better testing support and event-driven architecture
Performance Optimizations
Image Caching: Reduces bandwidth and improves loading times
Debounced Search: Prevents API spam during typing
Efficient Pagination: Only loads necessary data
State Persistence: Maintains scroll position during navigation
Known Limitations
Search Scope: Search only works on loaded products, not full catalog
Offline Filtering: Limited to cached data when offline
Image Dependencies: Requires internet for first-time image loading
API Constraints: Limited by Fake Store API capabilities
